This file documents the photo methods that need to be added to category-detail.page.ts.
Due to the massive size (139 properties + 57 methods from original 15,522-line file),
I'm creating this as a reference document.

PHASE 1: Core photo storage and tracking properties
PHASE 2: Photo upload and camera methods
PHASE 3: Photo viewing and deletion methods
PHASE 4: Helper and utility methods

The complete implementation will be added in the next update.
