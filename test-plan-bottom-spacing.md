# Test Plan: Dynamic Bottom Spacing Fix v1.4.215

## Issue Description
White space appearing at bottom of Engineers Foundation template page

## Solution Implemented
1. Added dynamic bottom spacer div (80px default height)
2. Made spacer responsive to viewport height:
   - < 600px: 50px spacer
   - 600-700px: 60px spacer  
   - 700-900px: 80px spacer (default)
   - > 900px: 100px spacer
3. Removed bottom padding from template-container
4. Spacer uses flex-shrink: 0 to prevent compression
