## üìù FIELD MAPPINGS & NOTES

### Default Values
- CompanyID: 1 (Noble Property Inspections)
- UserID: 1
- StatusID: 1 (Active)

### Important Field Notes
- **ProjectID**: Autonumber - DO NOT SEND (auto-generated by Caspio)
- **OffersID**: Can be NULL (allows service selection after creation)
- **Services.ProjectID**: Use actual ProjectID field, not PK_ID
- **Services.TypeID**: Integer from Types table
- **Services.DateOfInspection**: DateTime field
- **Attach.ProjectID**: Integer (foreign key)
- **Attach.TypeID**: Integer (foreign key)
- **Attach.Attachment**: File field (stores reference URL)
- **Attach.Link**: Text field (stores original filename)

## üÜï MOBILE APP IMPLEMENTATION (Latest Update)

### Project Details Auto-Save System
- [x] Added comprehensive Project Details section to all templates
- [x] 17 fields that auto-save to Projects table:
  - ClientName, AgentName, InspectorName
  - YearBuilt, SquareFeet, TypeOfBuilding, Style
  - InAttendance, WeatherConditions, OutdoorTemperature, OccupancyFurnishings
  - FirstFoundationType, SecondFoundationType, SecondFoundationRooms
  - ThirdFoundationType, ThirdFoundationRooms, OwnerOccupantInterview
- [x] Real-time save status indicators ("Saving..." ‚Üí "Saved")
- [x] Load existing project data when opening template
- [x] Visual feedback for completed fields

### Mobile-Compatible Template System
- [x] Created mobile-specific JavaScript functions (lines 5674-6235)
- [x] Direct Caspio API integration (no server proxy needed)
- [x] Client-side template generation
- [x] localStorage for ID management
- [x] Token management with auto-refresh
- [x] Removed URL-based navigation in favor of JavaScript functions

### Mobile App Functions Added
1. **Authentication**
   - `mobileAuthenticate()` - OAuth2 authentication with Caspio
   - `getMobileToken()` - Token management with auto-refresh

2. **Template Navigation**
   - `openTemplate()` - Works for both web and mobile environments
   - `loadTemplateView()` - Loads template without URL navigation
   - `generateMobileTemplate()` - Client-side HTML generation

3. **Data Management**
   - `loadMobileProjectData()` - Fetches project data from Caspio
   - `mobileAutoSave()` - Saves individual fields to Projects table
   - `initializeMobileTemplate()` - Initializes template with data

4. **UI Functions**
   - `toggleMobileSection()` - Section expand/collapse
   - `showMobileSaveStatus()` - Save status display
   - `backToProject()` - Navigation back to project view

### Key Mobile Adaptations
- **ID Management**: Uses actual ProjectID and ServiceID values, not URL parameters
- **API Calls**: Direct to Caspio REST API v2 (https://c2hcf092.caspio.com/rest/v2)
- **Navigation**: JavaScript-based instead of URL routing
- **Storage**: localStorage for persisting IDs and tokens
- **Rendering**: Client-side HTML generation instead of server-side

### Mobile Deployment Instructions
1. Extract mobile functions (lines 5674-6235) to separate mobile.js file
2. Include mobile.js in your mobile app
3. Add the CSS styles from `mobileTemplateStyles` constant
4. Update `MOBILE_CONFIG` with your Caspio credentials
5. Replace `document.getElementById('app')` with your app's main container ID
6. Implement `backToProject()` based on your app's navigation

### Mobile-Specific Changes Required
- Remove all references to `window.location` for navigation
- Replace `/api/*` endpoints with direct Caspio API calls
- Use `localStorage` instead of URL parameters for ID passing
- Implement app-specific navigation in `backToProject()`

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS / TODO
