      "description": "Loading category or room pages shows loading screen EVERY TIME page opens. User navigates in/out many times per report causing major delays. Using IndexedDB with Dexie liveQuery wrapper. Images are rolled up (lazy load on expand) so should NOT cause load delays. CRITICAL: Cannot lose live updates, data, or images. Every IndexedDB change should update cache to retain loaded info.",
