<objective>
Verify HUD Project Details page matches engineers-foundation exactly and functions correctly.

Purpose: Phase 6 research discovered that HUD Project Details is ALREADY an exact copy of EFE with only necessary naming differences (class name, selector, service import). This plan verifies the existing implementation works correctly rather than implementing changes.

Output: Verified working Project Details page with confirmation of layout, styling, and functionality parity

Compare HUD Project Details files to EFE Project Details files to confirm research findings:

1. **HTML comparison**: Compare `hud-project-details.page.html` with `project-details.page.html`
   - Should be byte-for-byte identical
   - Report any differences found

2. **SCSS comparison**: Compare `hud-project-details.page.scss` with `project-details.page.scss`
   - Should be byte-for-byte identical
   - Report any differences found

3. **TypeScript comparison**: Compare `hud-project-details.page.ts` with `project-details.page.ts`
   - Expected differences (acceptable):
     - Class name: `ProjectDetailsPage` vs `HudProjectDetailsPage`
     - Selector: `app-project-details` vs `app-hud-project-details`
     - Template/style file paths
     - Service import: `EngineersFoundationStateService` vs `HudStateService`
   - Unexpected differences: Report any logic differences

4. **Routing verification**: Confirm route is properly configured
   - Check `hud-routing.module.ts` includes HudProjectDetailsPage
   - Verify path `project-details` maps to HudProjectDetailsPage

Document findings in a brief report format. If any unexpected differences found that affect functionality, note them for potential fix task.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>HUD Project Details page (pre-existing implementation verified by Task 1)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
VISUAL AND FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION:

1. **Access the page**: Navigate to HUD Project Details
   - Open HUD template for any existing project
   - Tap "Project Details" navigation button
   - Page should load without errors

2. **Compare layout to EFE** (side-by-side if possible):
   - Open engineers-foundation Project Details for same or similar project
   - Compare section headers (People, Location, Conditions)
   - Compare form field layouts (3-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile)
   - Compare icon placement and sizing

3. **Verify styling**:
   - Font styles match (same font family, sizes, weights)
   - Colors match (labels, inputs, borders)
   - Spacing matches (padding, margins between sections)
   - Input styling matches (borders, placeholder text, filled state)

4. **Test functionality**:
   - Form fields load existing project data
   - Dropdowns populate with options from API
   - Text input changes trigger auto-save (check save status indicator)
   - Multi-select checkboxes work (In Attendance, Foundation Rooms)
   - "Other" option shows inline text input when selected

5. **Test mobile behavior** (if possible):
   - Single-column layout on narrow screens
   - Touch targets appropriately sized
   - Scrolling works smoothly

REPORT ANY ISSUES:
- Layout differences from EFE
- Styling inconsistencies
- Broken functionality
- Console errors
