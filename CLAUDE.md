# IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR CLAUDE

## üö® CRITICAL - NEVER CHANGE THE FILE UPLOAD METHOD üö®
**THE FILE UPLOAD METHOD BELOW IS TESTED AND WORKING. DO NOT MODIFY IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**

## üö® CRITICAL - DEBUGGING ON MOBILE üö®
**USER IS ON MOBILE WITHOUT CONSOLE ACCESS. USE TOASTS/ALERTS FOR DEBUG OUTPUT, NOT console.log**
- Use `await this.showToast('Debug: ' + message, 'info')` for debug output
- Use `alert()` for critical debug breakpoints
- NEVER rely on console.log for debugging - user cannot see it

## CURRENT APP STATE (as of December 2024)

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- **Photo Upload System**: Complete photo upload to Services_Visuals_Attach using VisualID
- **Multi-Photo Capture Loop**: Native iOS file picker + automatic "Take Another Photo" prompt after single photo
- **Native iOS Photo Selection**: Uses native file picker (Photo Library, Take Photo, Choose File)
- **Custom Visual Comments**: Add custom visuals with photos directly in creation popup
- **Photo Annotation System**: Full annotation with drawing tools (pen, arrows, circles, rectangles, text)
- **Photo Previews**: Working for all sections (Comments, Limitations, Deficiencies)
- **Photo Viewer**: Modal-based viewer without popup blockers
- **Engineers Foundation Template**: Complete visual selection and management
- **Floating Back-to-Top Button**: Smart detection of current section/accordion for precise navigation
- **Section Accordion Navigation**: Scrolls to expanded accordion headers (e.g., Basements) not just main sections
- **iOS Build**: Proper permissions (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, NSCameraUsageDescription)
- **Appflow Deployment**: Auto-adds iOS platform if missing, sets build numbers
- **Angular Build Budgets**: Increased to 40KB for component styles to accommodate Engineers Foundation page

### üì¶ Key Components:
- **PhotoAnnotatorComponent**: Canvas-based annotation with touch support
- **PhotoViewerComponent**: Modal photo viewer
- **Engineers Foundation Page**: Visual management with photo uploads

### üîß Services & APIs:
- **Services_Visuals**: Uses VisualID (NOT PK_ID) for foreign key
- **Services_Visuals_Attach**: VisualID links to photos
- **Response Format**: Always use `?response=rows` to get created records

## CRITICAL RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

### 1. VERSION UPDATES
**ALWAYS** update package.json version before commits:
- Location: `/mnt/c/Users/Owner/Caspio/package.json`
- Current: 1.3.49+
- Format: Major.Minor.Patch
- This tracks deployments and shows in app

### 2. üîí FILE UPLOAD METHOD (PROVEN WORKING - NEVER CHANGE!)
**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This method is confirmed working. DO NOT MODIFY! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

```javascript
// STEP 1: Upload file to Caspio Files API
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', fileBlob, fileName);

const uploadResponse = await fetch(`https://${account}.caspio.com/rest/v2/files`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  body: formData
});

const uploadResult = await uploadResponse.json();
// Returns: { Name: "filename.jpg" }

// STEP 2: Create Attach record with the file PATH (not the file itself!)
const filePath = `/${uploadResult.Name}`;  // e.g., "/IMG_1234.jpg"

const recordResponse = await fetch(`https://${account}.caspio.com/rest/v2/tables/Attach/records`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    ProjectID: projectId,      // Integer
    TypeID: typeId,            // Integer
    Title: title,              // String
    Notes: notes,              // String
    Link: fileName,            // String (original filename)
    Attachment: filePath       // String (PATH from Files API, e.g., "/filename.jpg")
    // NO ServiceID - this field DOES NOT EXIST
  })
});
```

### 3. SERVICES_VISUALS CRITICAL POINTS:
- **Use VisualID from response**, NOT PK_ID
- **Services_Visuals_Attach** requires VisualID (integer)
- **Text field** is included for visual descriptions
- **Always check response?.VisualID first**, then fallback to PK_ID

### 4. PHOTO ANNOTATION:
- **PhotoAnnotatorComponent** is standalone with FormsModule
- **Drawing tools**: pen, arrow, rectangle, circle, text
- **Touch support** for mobile devices
- **Single photos** get annotation option, batch uploads skip it
- **Saves as JPEG** at 0.9 quality

### 5. iOS BUILD CONFIGURATION:
- **Build number** in `ios-build-config.json`
- **Permissions** auto-added by `scripts/set-ios-permissions.js`
- **Platform** auto-created by `appflow-ios-build.js` if missing
- **Increment build number** for each App Store submission

### 6. CASPIO TABLE STRUCTURE:
```
Attach Table:
- AttachID, ProjectID, TypeID, Title, Notes, Link, Attachment
- NO ServiceID field

Services Table:
- ProjectID, TypeID, DateOfInspection
- NO OffersID field

Services_Visuals:
- VisualID (primary key)
- ServiceID, Category, Kind, Name, Text, Notes

Services_Visuals_Attach:
- VisualID (foreign key)
- Annotation, Photo
```

### 7. UI/UX RULES:
- **Green color** ONLY in Required Documents table
- **Service selections** persist when navigating
- **No temp IDs** - Caspio returns real IDs instantly
- **Photo previews** show immediately after upload
- **Debug popups** removed for production

### 8. GIT COMMIT RULES:
```bash
git commit -m "Brief description of changes

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### 9. TESTING COMMANDS:
```bash
npm run lint          # Check code style
npm run build         # Build for production
npm run build:ios-local  # Local iOS build with platform creation
```

### 10. COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
- ‚ùå Don't use ServiceID for attachments (doesn't exist)
- ‚ùå Don't use OffersID for services (doesn't exist)
- ‚ùå Don't use PK_ID for Services_Visuals foreign keys (use VisualID)
- ‚ùå Don't modify file upload method (it works perfectly)
- ‚ùå Don't send base64 to Attachment field (use file path)
- ‚ùå Don't forget FormsModule for components using ngModel
- ‚ùå Don't create temp IDs (Caspio returns real ones instantly)
- ‚ùå Don't use console.log for debugging (user is on mobile - use toasts/alerts)
- ‚ùå Don't create custom action sheets for photo selection (use native iOS picker)
- ‚ùå Don't send RoomName when creating Services_Rooms (only send ServiceID)
- ‚ùå Don't call methods uploadPhotoToVisual (correct: uploadPhotoForVisual)

### 11. PROJECT SPECIFICS:
- **Company**: Noble Property Inspections (CompanyID: 1)
- **Main Tables**: Projects, Services, Attach, Offers, Types, Templates
- **Navigation**: /tabs/active-projects, /project/:id, /template-form/:projectId/:offersId
- **Live Updates**: appId: 1e8beef6

### 12. RECENT UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS (Version 1.3.80+):
- **Multi-Photo Loop**: When user takes single photo via native iOS picker, automatically prompts "Take Another Photo" or "Done"
- **Native iOS File Picker**: Removed custom action sheets - uses native iOS popup for photo selection
- **Compact Photo Selector**: Orange-text iOS-style alerts for photo continuation
- **Smart Scroll Navigation**: Floating button detects current accordion/room and scrolls to appropriate header
- **Elevation Room Headers**: Show PointCount from Services_Rooms_Templates
- **No Success Toasts**: Removed green success messages when adding visuals for cleaner UX
- **Action Sheet Auto-Dismiss**: Photo selection popups dismiss immediately after selection

### 13. CURRENT FOCUS AREAS:
- ‚úÖ Photo uploads working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Custom visuals with inline photo option
- ‚úÖ Photo annotation system complete
- ‚úÖ iOS deployment configuration fixed
- ‚úÖ Native iOS UI integration for photo selection
- üîß Accordion scroll detection (improved but may need refinement)
- üîß SCSS file size optimization (increased budget to 40KB)

## REMEMBER: INCREMENT VERSION IN PACKAGE.JSON FOR EVERY MEANINGFUL CHANGE!
