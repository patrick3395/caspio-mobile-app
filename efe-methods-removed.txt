PRESERVED METHODS:
==================

The following methods were PRESERVED as requested:
- All Visual-related methods (loadVisualCategories, onVisualChange, takePhotoForVisual, etc.)
- All PDF-related methods
- All project-related methods
- General camera/photo methods used by Visuals

NEXT STEPS:
===========

The file still contains references to the removed methods (method calls).
These will need to be addressed separately:
- Remove calls to loadRoomTemplates() in ngOnInit
- Remove calls to loadFDFOptions()
- Remove EFE-related UI components from the template
- Remove EFE-related properties and imports
- Update any conditional logic that references removed methods

NOTE: The TypeScript file may now have compilation errors due to:
1. Missing method implementations
2. Unused imports
3. Unused properties/variables
4. References to removed methods in other parts of the code
