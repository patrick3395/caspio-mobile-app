# Live Updates Disabled - Version 1.1.39+

## Issue Summary
Live Updates have been completely disabled starting from version 1.1.39 due to persistent corruption issues causing:
- "Failure occurred during unpack step. File Manager Error"
- "IonicLiveUpdate.FilerOperationsError 0"
- App screen flashing repeatedly
- Required uninstall/reinstall to fix

## Solution Implemented
1. **Disabled Live Updates** in `capacitor.config.ts` (`disableDeploy: true`)
2. **Removed update checks** from app initialization
3. **Commented out sync calls** to prevent any Live Update operations
4. **Using bundled version only** - requires new app store releases for updates

## How to Deploy Updates Now
Since Live Updates are disabled, all updates must be deployed through:
1. App Store (iOS)
2. Google Play Store (Android)
3. Direct APK distribution (Android)

## Clean Build Process
Always use clean builds to prevent issues:
```bash
npm run clean-build
```

This script:
- Removes all build artifacts
- Cleans iOS/Android build folders
- Creates fresh production build
- Syncs with Capacitor

## Future Considerations
Live Updates can be re-enabled when:
1. Ionic fixes the corruption bug
2. A more stable update mechanism is available
3. Differential updates work reliably

## Version History
- v1.1.36: First corruption detected
- v1.1.37: Attempted fix with error handling
- v1.1.38: Added debug popups
- v1.1.39: **DISABLED Live Updates completely**

## Important Notes
- All future deployments use bundled version only
- No over-the-air updates
- More stable but requires app store updates
- Prevents corruption and flashing issues
