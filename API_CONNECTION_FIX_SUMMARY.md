# API Connection Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your mobile and web app were experiencing hourly (~60 minute) connectivity outages where:
- All APIs stopped working
- Projects couldn't load
- "API does not exist" errors appeared
- Connections restored after ~1 minute

**Root Cause:** OAuth tokens expire every 60 minutes. Your app was using `setTokenExpirationTimer()` which **abruptly cleared** the token at expiration, causing all pending and future API requests to fail immediately. There was no proactive refresh mechanism, creating a "dead zone" until user interaction triggered re-authentication.

---

## Solution Implemented

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Critical Token Management Fixes

#### 1. **Proactive Token Refresh** (Lines 109-122)
- Token now **automatically refreshes at 90% of lifetime** (54 minutes instead of 60)
- Old token stays valid until new one is confirmed
- Prevents the expiration "dead zone"

#### 2. **Authentication Mutex** (Lines 208-241)
- Added `isRefreshing` flag to prevent concurrent authentication attempts
- Uses `refreshTokenSubject` to queue requests during token refresh
- Only one authentication can happen at a time

#### 3. **Request Queuing During Refresh** (Lines 250-288)
- `getValidToken()` method now queues requests when refresh is in progress
- Requests automatically retry after new token obtained
- No requests fail during token refresh

#### 4. **Token Validation Before Requests** (Lines 199-206)
- New `isTokenValid()` checks if token expires within 5 minutes
- Proactively triggers refresh if token is about to expire
- Prevents using expired tokens

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Error Handling & Resilience

#### 5. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** (Lines 332-367)
- GET requests now retry up to 3 times on network failures
- Exponential backoff: 1 second ‚Üí 2 seconds ‚Üí 4 seconds
- Smart retry: doesn't retry auth errors (401, 403) or bad requests (400)
- Logs each retry attempt in debug mode

#### 6. **Enhanced Error Messages** (Lines 388-417)
- Differentiated error types:
  - **401**: "Authentication failed - invalid or expired token"
  - **403**: "Access forbidden - insufficient permissions"
  - **404**: "API endpoint not found"
  - **0**: "Network error - please check your connection"
  - **500+**: "Server error - please try again later"

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Monitoring & Debugging

#### 7. **Token Lifecycle Logging** (Throughout caspio.service.ts)
- Added `debugMode` flag (line 43) - set to `true` to enable detailed logging
- Logs token acquisition, refresh, expiration events
- Tracks failed auth attempts with context
- Console output uses emojis for easy visual scanning:
  - üîê Token set
  - üîì Token loaded
  - üîÑ Token refresh
  - ‚úÖ Success
  - ‚ùå Failure
  - ‚è∞ Timer events
  - üöÄ Cache hits
  - üíæ Cache writes

#### 8. **Connection Health Monitoring** (New service)
- Created `ConnectionMonitorService` (connection-monitor.service.ts)
- Tracks API response times and success rates over 5-minute window
- Records last 100 requests
- Exposes health metrics:
  - `isHealthy`: Overall connection health (boolean)
  - `successRate`: Percentage of successful requests (0-100)
  - `averageResponseTime`: Average response time in ms
  - `recentFailures`: Count of consecutive recent failures
  - `lastSuccessTime`: Timestamp of last successful request
  - `lastFailureTime`: Timestamp of last failed request

## How to Use

### Enable Debug Logging

To see detailed token lifecycle logs, edit `caspio.service.ts` line 43:

```typescript
private debugMode = true; // Set to true to enable detailed logging
```

Then check your browser console for detailed logs about:
- Token refresh timing
- Retry attempts
- Cache hits/misses
- Authentication flow

### Monitor Connection Health

Access connection health from any component:

```typescript
constructor(private caspio: CaspioService) {}

ngOnInit() {
  // Subscribe to connection health updates
  this.caspio.getConnectionHealth().subscribe(health => {
    console.log('Connection health:', health);
    if (!health.isHealthy) {
      console.warn('Connection unhealthy!', {
        successRate: health.successRate,
        recentFailures: health.recentFailures
      });
    }
  });

  // Or check health status directly
  const isHealthy = this.caspio.isConnectionHealthy();
}
```

### Optional: Add UI Health Indicator

You can add a subtle connection indicator to your UI:

```typescript
// In your component
healthStatus$ = this.caspio.getConnectionHealth();
```

```html
<!-- In your template -->
<div *ngIf="(healthStatus$ | async) as health" class="connection-status">
  <span *ngIf="!health.isHealthy" class="warning">
    Connection issues detected ({{health.successRate | number:'1.0-0'}}% success rate)
  </span>
</div>
```

## Testing the Fix

### Verify Token Refresh Works

1. **Enable debug mode** (set `debugMode = true`)
2. Open browser console
3. Use the app normally
4. After 54 minutes, you should see:
   ```
   ‚è∞ Proactive token refresh triggered at 90% lifetime
   üîÑ Starting token refresh
   ‚úÖ Token refresh successful
   üîê Token set: { expiresIn: 3600, ... }
   ```
5. **No connectivity loss should occur!**

### Test Retry Logic

1. Enable debug mode
2. Disconnect network briefly while making requests
3. Reconnect network
4. Console should show:
   ```
   ‚è≥ Retry 1/3 for /tables/Projects after 1000ms
   ‚è≥ Retry 2/3 for /tables/Projects after 2000ms
   ‚úÖ Request succeeded after retry
   ```

### Monitor Over 2+ Hours

The ultimate test:
1. Leave app open and active for 2+ hours
2. Navigate between pages regularly
3. **You should see NO connectivity outages**
4. Token should refresh automatically at 54 min, 108 min, 162 min, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see connectivity issues:

1. **Enable debug mode** and check console logs
2. Look for these patterns:
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è Token expired (100% lifetime)" ‚Üí refresh didn't work, investigate
   - "‚ùå Token refresh failed" ‚Üí check network or API credentials
   - "‚ùå Max retries exceeded" ‚Üí persistent network issues
3. Check connection health:
   ```typescript
   const health = this.caspio.isConnectionHealthy();
   console.log('Healthy?', health);
   ```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Debug logs don't appear
- **Fix:** Ensure `debugMode = true` in line 43 of caspio.service.ts

**Issue:** Still seeing hourly outages
- **Fix:** Check console for "‚è∞ Proactive token refresh triggered" - if missing, timers aren't firing
- Possible cause: App might be suspended in background (mobile-specific)

**Issue:** Errors say "Authentication failed"
- **Fix:** Check environment.caspio credentials are correct
- Verify token endpoint is accessible

## Performance Impact

The solution is **highly optimized** and adds minimal overhead:

- **Token refresh:** Proactive (1 request every 60 min vs reactive multiple failures)
- **Retry logic:** Only activates on failures (no impact on successful requests)
- **Connection monitoring:** Lightweight (stores last 100 requests, ~5KB memory)
- **Debug logging:** Disabled by default (zero performance impact)

**Net result:** Actually **improves** performance by preventing failures and unnecessary re-authentication!

## Conclusion

The fix addresses the root cause (abrupt token expiration) with a comprehensive solution:

1. **Proactive token refresh** prevents the expiration dead zone
2. **Authentication mutex** prevents race conditions
3. **Request queuing** ensures no requests fail during refresh
4. **Retry logic** handles transient network failures
5. **Enhanced errors** help diagnose issues quickly
6. **Connection monitoring** provides visibility and diagnostics
7. **Debug logging** enables troubleshooting when needed

**Expected outcome:** Zero connectivity outages, seamless token refresh, and robust error handling.
